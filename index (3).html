    Maharishi Vidya Mandir® Schools Group of India is being managed by Maharishi Shiksha Sansthan®, a national level society registered under the society registration act XXI of 1860.
    
    Maharishi Vidya Mandir® Schools (MVMs) is leading amongst best public schools in India like all other Maharishi Institutions is established to introduce Maharishiji's Consciousness Based Education System in mainstream school education to its students. This system (MCBE) has been tried, implemented successfully and is repeatedly verified by over 700 scientific research studies conducted in 215 universities and independent research institutions of 35 countries. These studies have been published in 6 volumes and have documented the remarkable benefits of Consciousness Based Education e.g. greater use of intelligence, superior brain wave functioning, faster learning ability, faster reaction time, coherent thought process, longer retention of knowledge, improved health and reversal of aging.
    
    Maharishi Vidya Mandir® Schools have a unique approach to complete and holistic education. The genius of Maharishi school curriculum is that every student studying different subjects identified by the NCERT and Central Board of Secondary Education, seamlessly integrates these with Supreme Science of Life-Vedic Science and Technology.
    
    All students practice Yog, Maharishi Transcendental Meditation and Advance Techniques, to attain higher states of consciousness. This scientific approach to train and balance correlation between mind, body and consciousness has received wide appreciation from parents and they have acknowledged the substantial improvement in their wards.
    
    In the words of Maharishi Ji, 'the roots of modern day problems are the incomplete growth of human brain because of incomplete, fragmented education. The education is incomplete when the student is not able to utilize or develop the creative brain potential, thereby allowing imbalances to creep in.
    
    ‘The dissatisfaction created by the failure is nothing but an outcome of cumulative stress and strain due to gross violation of the laws of Nature. Thereby, it is essential to take the knowledge through education to pure consciousness level, where all the laws of Nature are aligned. This facilitates every student to adhere to the Laws of Nature and to realise an ideal and successful environment’.
    
    To fulfill this aim, MVMs are establishing the value of pure consciousness in students across the country, thereby not only helping the students to gain conventional knowledge for gaining professional skills but also for gaining total knowledge of natural law for personal life. This allows the students to lead a stress-free and strain free life to accomplish their desires without any difficulty. The aim is to allow each generation to enjoy fruits of all knowledge and with its own accomplished life, enliven whole world consciousness and play again the role of Jagat Guru.</p>
